# Hosted CTFd Instance Limits


### View Limits

Hosted CTFd instances track the amount of page views that they receive.

Views refer to the number of requests to your CTFd instance each month. These are tracked and incremented with every page or API request. Each instance tier has a different page view limit.

We don't disable instances for going beyond the page view limit but if an instance goes beyond 1.25x the monthly page view limit, it will be upgraded to the next tier.
