## New Instances

When you create a new hosted CTFd instance, an invoice will be processed and available within 1 hour of purchase. Each invoice is for 30 days of usage of a hosted CTFd instance. An initial test charge of \$1 will be placed on provided credit cards and will disappear within 7 days. Invoice history is available in your [profile page](https://cloud.ctfd.io/profile) under the Billing pane.

## Renewing Instances

Renewed instances will be charged 30 days from the previous payment date. If you would like to cancel your subscription prior to renewal, you must destroy the CTF in the instance view. If a charge occurs inadvertently please contact us.

### Failed Payments

If your payment fails, you will receive an email notifying you to update your card information. Once renewed, you will be charged and the CTF will be paid for. If payment is not received within 7 days of the due date, your instance will be shutdown.
