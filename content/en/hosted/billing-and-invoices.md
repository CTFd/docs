# Hosted CTFd

---

### New Instances

When you create a new hosted CTFd instance, you will be billed for the first month (30 days) of your CTFd instance. If you choose a yearly billing cycle you will be billed for the first 12 months (360 days) of your CTFd instance. An invoice will be processed and available within 1 hour of purchase. An initial test charge of $1 will be placed on provided credit cards and will disappear within 7 days. Invoice history is available in your [profile page](https://cloud.ctfd.io/profile) under the Billing pane.

### Renewing Instances

Renewed instances will be charged 1 month or 12 months (depending on billing cycle) from the previous payment date. If you would like to cancel your subscription prior to renewal, you must destroy the CTF in the [management dashboard](https://cloud.ctfd.io). If a charge occurs inadvertently please [contact us](https://ctfd.io/contact/).

### Failed Payments

If a renewal payment fails, you will receive an email notifying you to update your card information. Once your card information is updated, your invoice payments will be retried. If payment is not received within 7 days of the due date, your instance will be disabled. If payment is not received within 30 days your instance will be deleted entirely.
