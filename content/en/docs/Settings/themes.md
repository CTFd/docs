CTFd allows organizers to change how the website looks to users through themes. Themes allow for significant changes in how the scoreboard, challenge board, user pages, team pages, etc. are all represented to the user.

Themes are comprised of Jinja2 templates, JavaScript, and CSS. We offer custom CTFd themes for sale at [the online store](https://ctfd.io/store/) and community themes can be found on [Github](https://github.com/CTFd/themes).

At this time, hosted CTFd instances receive access to all themes on the CTFd Store and Pro and Enterprise level instances can have custom themes loaded in.
