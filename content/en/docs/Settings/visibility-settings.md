From the **_Settings_** tab in the Config page, Admins are able to control the following:

1. Challenge Visibility
2. Score Visibility
3. Account Visibility
4. Registration Visibility

### Challenge Visibility

Admins have the option to keep challenges in **_Public_**, **_Private_** or **_Admins Only_**.

If **_Admins Only_** is selected, users aren't able to access any challenges and will see a forbidden page like the screenshot below:

![](/images/settings/Forbidden_Page.png)

On the other hand, the **_Public_** option allows registered and non-registered users to view the challenges while the **_Private_** option only allows registered users to view the challenges.

### Score Visibility

Once scores are available, Admins can control whether to show scores as **_Public_**, **_Private_**, **_Hidden_** or **_Admins Only_**.

![](/images/settings/Score_Visibility.png)

- Public: Scores can be viewed by everyone
- Private: Logged in users can view the scores
- Hidden: Non-Admins cannot view the scores and will have a forbidden page prompt
- Admins Only: Scores can only be viewed by Admins and the Scoreboard link will be removed from the navbar

### Account Visibility

Control visibility of user's and team's scores, solved questions, percentage of questions solved, etc.

![](/images/settings/Account_Visibility.png)

- Public – User accounts are visible to everyone
- Private – Only registered users can see other account information
- Admins Only – Accounts are only visible by Admins in the Admin Panel

{{% alert title="Caution" color="warning" %}}
Score Visibility and Account Visibility should generally be the same to avoid conflicts. If they're different odd situations can occur where a user's score can be seen on their profile but not on the scoreboard.
{{% /alert %}}

### Registration Visibility

Allows Admin to control if registration is available to the **_Public_**, **_Private_** or **_MajorLeagueCyber Only_**.

![](/images/settings/Registration_Visibility.png)

- Public: Registration is public and open to everyone
- Private: Registration is disabled and users can only login with an existing account or if an account is created for them
- MajorLeagueCyber Only: Users can only login if they have an account on the MajorLeagueCyber Event Tracker
